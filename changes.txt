	if (!collision):
		return
		
	var collider = collision.get_collider()
	print(collider) #debug only prints the object it had collided with
	if collider is Brick:
		collider.decrease_level()
	if (collider is Brick or collider is Paddle):
		ball_collision(collider)
		if (collider is Paddle):
			$Paddle_Bounce.play()
		if (collider is Brick):
			$Brick_Hit.play()

		velocity = velocity.bounce(collision.get_normal())
	if collider is Wall:
